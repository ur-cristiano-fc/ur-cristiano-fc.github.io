## At What Age Did Ronaldo Start Playing Football Officially?

Cristiano Ronaldo officially began his football career at **age 7**, when he joined **CF Andorinha**.

### Why Age 7 Matters

This early age is significant because:

* It set the foundation for his technical growth.
* It allowed him to develop discipline early.
* It aligned with the "critical learning window" for athletes.

His father, **José Dinis Aveiro**, worked at the club as a kit man. This connection helped Ronaldo spend more time around football, giving him access to practice grounds and equipment.

---

## The Influence of Family

Ronaldo’s father played a major role in his entry into football. Although the family struggled financially, his father's position at CF Andorinha gave Ronaldo an early introduction to structured training.

His mother, **Maria Dolores**, encouraged him despite initial worries about balancing school and sports.

---

## Transition to Clube Desportivo Nacional

At **age 10**, Ronaldo joined **Nacional**, one of Madeira’s biggest clubs.

This move was crucial because:

* It exposed him to tougher competition.
* Coaches quickly recognized he was above his age level.
* His training intensity increased.

Ronaldo demonstrated the mindset described in *How to Finish Everything You Start* — staying focused even when games or training sessions became difficult.

---

## Moving to Sporting Lisbon at Age 12: The Turning Point

At **12 years old**, Ronaldo made the life‑changing decision to move to **Sporting Lisbon’s academy**, leaving his family behind in Madeira.

This was a defining moment because:
