In 2026, Cristiano Ronaldo will be 41 years old. He was born on February 5, 1985, meaning he will celebrate his 41st birthday early in 2026. This age is quite remarkable for a professional footballer playing at the top level.

You'll be watching a true sporting anomaly, defying expectations about career longevity. It's a testament to his unique athleticism and iron will. Truly a master of his craft.

#### H3: What is Ronaldo's role expected to be for Al Nassr in 2026?

Ronaldo's role for Al Nassr in 2026 is expected to remain central to their attack. He will likely continue as a primary striker or a forward with significant freedom to roam. While he might play fewer full ninety-minute matches consecutively, his impact will still be immense.

He will be a crucial leader, bringing experience and a winning mentality to the team. You can count on him to be the main goal threat. His presence elevates the entire team's performance.

#### H3: Will Ronaldo play for Portugal in the 2026 World Cup?

Generally, goals scored in friendly matches are not counted in official competitive statistics. This means they don't add to league totals, Champions League totals, or World Cup totals. However, they are often recorded by clubs and national teams for historical purposes.
