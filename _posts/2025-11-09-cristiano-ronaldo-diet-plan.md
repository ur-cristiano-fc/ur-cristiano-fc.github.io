## Daily Eating Schedule: Six Meals a Day
One of the defining features of the **Ronaldo diet** is meal frequency. Instead of three large meals, he consumes **six smaller meals a day**. This strategy prevents energy crashes, stabilizes blood sugar, and optimizes training performance.

| Time | Meal Type | Example Foods |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 7:00 AM | **Breakfast** | Egg whites, **avocado toast**, whole-grain bread, black coffee |
| 10:00 AM | **Snack** | Seasonal fruit, Greek yogurt, or oatmeal |
| 1:00 PM | **Lunch #1** | Grilled chicken or **sea bass**, quinoa, steamed vegetables |
| 4:00 PM | **Lunch #2 / Snack** | Tuna sandwich on whole grain or cottage cheese and fruit |
| 7:00 PM | **Dinner** | Grilled fish (often **sea bass** or salmon) with salad and legumes |
| 9:00 PM | **Pre-Bed** | Low-fat yogurt or whey **protein shakes** |

This structure supports constant nutrient delivery, helps maintain metabolism, and aids in recovery throughout the day.

- Soda (especially commercial cola drinks)
- Deep-fried fast food
- Artificial sweeteners and refined sugars

## Hydration and Fluids

After games or tough workouts, his recovery meals focus on:

During the off-season, he focuses more on reducing total calories and keeping protein high to maintain muscle mass without unnecessary fat gain.

Meals are usually:
- Prepared using healthy cooking methods (grilling, baking, steaming)
- Free from heavy oils and added sugars
- Made in portion sizes that match activity level

---

## Sample Full Day Meal Plan (Expanded)

**Breakfast:** Egg white omelet with spinach, **avocado toast**, and black coffee  
**Snack:** Greek yogurt with berries  
**Lunch:** Grilled **sea bass**, brown rice, broccoli, olive oil drizzle  
**Snack:** Whole-grain tuna sandwich  
**Dinner:** Salmon with mixed salad and lentils  
**Pre-Bed:** Whey **protein shake** with water  

This is a simple framework anyone can adapt.

---

- Faster muscle recovery
- Improved endurance
- Reduced muscle fatigue
- Better sleep and tissue repair

His performance at age 39 continues to remain elite because of this disciplined alignment between training and nutrition.
