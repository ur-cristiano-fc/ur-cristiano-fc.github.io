## From Madeira to Madrid: A Star in the Making
Before we explore Ronaldo’s family dynamics, it’s worth revisiting his journey.

Born in a humble home in Madeira, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro grew up with three siblings. His father was a kit man and his mother worked as a cook and cleaning lady. Ronaldo often credits his mother, Dolores Aveiro, for being his rock.

### Family First, Even Then
Even during his early career in Sporting CP and Manchester United, Ronaldo stayed connected with his mother and siblings. In fact, he often flew his family out to attend major games.

## Meet the Ronaldo Clan
### 1. **Cristiano Ronaldo Jr.**
Born in 2010, Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. is the eldest and perhaps the most well-known of Ronaldo’s children. Raised largely out of the public eye in his early years, he now trains in youth academies and seems to be following in his dad’s footsteps.

### 2. **Eva and Mateo**
Born in 2017 via surrogacy, the twins have brought even more joy into Ronaldo’s life. He frequently shares adorable pictures of the two on social media.

### 3. **Alana Martina**
Daughter of Ronaldo and long-time partner Georgina Rodríguez, Alana was born in November 2017. Alana often appears in family photos and travels with Ronaldo across the world.
