## 1. Who Is Maria Dolores Aveiro?

**Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro** was born on **December 31, 1954**, in the Portuguese island of Madeira. Coming from a humble background, she grew up in a large family with limited means. Life wasn’t easy in the small parish of São Pedro, Funchal, where economic hardship was a daily reality.
