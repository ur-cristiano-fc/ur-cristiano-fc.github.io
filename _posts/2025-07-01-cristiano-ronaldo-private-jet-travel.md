Cristiano Ronaldo is more than a football superstar—he’s a brand. His travel habits reflect a life of precision, comfort, and strategic choices. From quick trips for matches to long-haul vacations and promotional tours, Ronaldo flies frequently and in style. But how exactly does he travel? The answer lies in his personal aircraft.

## Cristiano Ronaldo's Private Jet: Gulfstream G200
