## The Origin of Caleçon CR7: Where Sport Meets Style

When Cristiano Ronaldo launched his **CR7 Underwear** brand, it wasn’t just another celebrity endorsement. It was a vision — to bring athletic precision and aesthetic design to men’s underwear. The brand name itself, **Caleçon CR7** (meaning ‘CR7 boxers’ in French), perfectly combines Ronaldo’s global appeal with his dedication to excellence.

Ronaldo partnered with the renowned Danish designer **Richard Chai** and the JBS Textile Group, one of Europe’s leading underwear manufacturers. This collaboration brought together high fashion, sports performance, and modern masculinity — three pillars that define the CR7 brand.

The goal was simple: to create underwear that performs as well as Ronaldo does on the field — supportive, stylish, and built for confidence.

## The Design Philosophy Behind CR7 Underwear

### 1. **Performance Meets Comfort**

Every Caleçon CR7 piece is designed with athletes and active men in mind. Breathable fabrics, elastic waistbands, and ergonomic fits ensure comfort during workouts or daily wear. Ronaldo’s obsession with perfection is visible in the smallest details — from stitch patterns to waistband elasticity.

### 2. **Minimalism and Modern Aesthetics**

Unlike overly branded underwear lines, CR7 focuses on clean lines, bold colors, and subtle branding. The result is an elegant yet powerful statement. Ronaldo’s belief is that **confidence starts with what you wear underneath**, and the CR7 design mirrors that philosophy.
