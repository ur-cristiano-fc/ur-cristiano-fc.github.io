### Annual Earnings Side-by-Side

| Source        | Estimated Annual Earnings (2025) |
|---------------|----------------------------------|
| Football      | $200 million                     |
| Instagram     | $16.3 – $22.4 million            |

Ronaldo’s football salary is nearly ten times higher than his Instagram income in 2025. However, his social media earnings alone would still place him among the world’s top-earning influencers and athletes.

### Per-Post vs Per-Match Earnings

- **Instagram Post:** $1.4 – $1.9 million
- **Football Match:** Estimated at $2.5 – $3 million per match, depending on appearances and bonuses (based on 60–80 matches per year)

### Key Takeaway

While football remains Ronaldo’s primary source of income, Instagram provides a lucrative secondary revenue stream that few athletes or celebrities can match.
