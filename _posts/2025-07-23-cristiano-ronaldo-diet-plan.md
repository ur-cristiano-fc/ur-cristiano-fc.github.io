## Daily Eating Schedule: Six Meals a Day
One of the defining features of the **Ronaldo diet** is meal frequency. Instead of three large meals, he consumes **six smaller meals a day**. This strategy prevents energy crashes, stabilizes blood sugar, and optimizes training performance.

| Time | Meal Type | Example Foods |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| 7:00 AM | **Breakfast** | Egg whites, **avocado toast**, whole-grain bread, black coffee |
| 10:00 AM | **Snack** | Seasonal fruit, Greek yogurt, or oatmeal |
| 1:00 PM | **Lunch #1** | Grilled chicken or **sea bass**, quinoa, steamed vegetables |
| 4:00 PM | **Lunch #2 / Snack** | Tuna sandwich on whole grain or cottage cheese and fruit |
| 7:00 PM | **Dinner** | Grilled fish (often **sea bass** or salmon) with salad and legumes |
| 9:00 PM | **Pre-Bed** | Low-fat yogurt or whey **protein shakes** |

This structure supports constant nutrient delivery, helps maintain metabolism, and aids in recovery throughout the day.
